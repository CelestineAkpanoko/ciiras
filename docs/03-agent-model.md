# Agent Model

CIIRAS is agentic, but not free-form.

The agent follows a closed loop:

Observe → Structure → Hypothesize → Verify → Decide → Act → Learn

The agent:
- cannot directly modify code,
- cannot bypass policy,
- cannot execute arbitrary commands.

All actions are performed through MCP tools with explicit schemas and audit logging.
